This extension provides [PHP Typography][] formatting for text fields.

## Synopsis

Improve your web typography with: hyphenation, space control, intelligent character replacement, and CSS hooks. This text formatter allows you to choose from the following text formatting languages:

* Plain HTML
* Markdown
* Markdown Extra
* Textile

The formatted text is then run through the [PHP Typography][] library. This extension is a spiritual successor to my old "Typogrify" extension - the two shouldn't be used together, and this extension is likely to produce better results.


## Installation & Updating

Information about [installing and updating extensions](http://symphony-cms.com/learn/tasks/view/install-an-extension/) can be found in the Symphony documentation at <http://symphony-cms.com/learn/>.
